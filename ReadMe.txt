DDE Command v1.5.1
==================

Introduction
------------

This is a command line (aka console) based tool for querying text data from DDE
servers. It provides support for both the synchronous and asynchronous DDE
transaction types: XTYP_REQUEST, XTYP_POKE, XTYP_EXECUTE and XTYP_ADVDATA. It
also allows for querying running servers with the XTYP_WILDCONNECT transaction
type.

This tool forms one part of my DDE toolkit, with the others being:-

DDE Query: My original GUI based DDE query tool.
DDE COM Client: A scriptable COM component for accessing DDE servers.
